# 2017Knight2017's Flash Favorites

**[en | [ru](README_ru.md)]**

This playlist contains **464 games** that I used to play in my childhood (roughly between 2011 and 2018).  
I played them mostly on the following sites:
- [Friv.com](https://www.friv.com)
- [Yepi.com](https://www.yepi.com)
- [A10.com](https://www.a10.com)
- [Izi.com](https://izi.com)
- Official websites of Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney, Lego
- Other Flash game portals of that time

A demo showcase of the games included in this playlist is available [here](DEMO.md).

## How to import the playlist into Flashpoint

1. Download the playlist `.json` file.  
2. Open the *Flashpoint Launcher*.  
3. In the top menu, click *Library → Playlists*.  
4. In the bottom-left corner, click *Import Playlist*.  
5. Select the previously downloaded `.json` file.  
6. The new playlist will appear in the list on the left.  
7. Done!

### Note
- None of the games in this list were **created** by me, nor do I **own** them. All rights belong to their respective owners.

## shuffle_playlist.exe
Since I originally discovered these games in a random order, I’d like to offer you the same experience by providing a *playlist shuffling script*.

All you need to do is run the script and specify the path to the playlist **without quotation marks** (playlists are usually located at `Flashpoint/Data/Playlists`).

This collection is my personal time capsule. I hope many of these games bring you nostalgia as well. Have fun!
